## Acknowledgments

This project was initially inspired by [Build The ULTIMATE JavaScript Portfolio Project To Get A Job!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEa99-NQ9Bk) by James Quick. I used the tutorial as a starting point and have since significantly expanded the project's functionality, including:
- Integrating the YouTube API for enhanced search capabilities.
- Enhancing the UI with additional CSS for a more engaging user experience.
- Modifying the base functionality to include custom gallery management features.

A heartfelt thank you to James Quick for providing the foundation and inspiration for this work.
